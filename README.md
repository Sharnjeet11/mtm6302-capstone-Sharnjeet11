Project: Pokedox site
Explanation of design decision: In the Pokedox website mockup, I prioritized a clean and intuitive user interface to enhance user experience. The color scheme draws inspiration from vibrant Pokémon palettes, creating a visually appealing design. Its layouts showcase Pokémon details, ensuring a seamless blend of information and aesthetics. Overall, the goal is to immerse users in a visually engaging and user-friendly environment that captures the essence of the Pokémon world.
