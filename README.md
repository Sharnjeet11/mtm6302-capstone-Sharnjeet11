**Pokedex Web Application Report**

Overview:
The Pokedex web application was developed to provide users with a visually appealing interface to browse and interact with Pokemon data retrieved from the PokeApi. The application allows users to view a gallery of Pokemon, load more Pokemon as needed, view details of each Pokemon, mark them as caught, and release them. 

Steps Taken:

1. Planning and Research:
   - Researched the requirements and resources provided, including the PokeApi documentation.
   - Planned the structure of the application and the interactions it should support.

2. Setting Up the Project:
   - Created the basic file structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - Set up initial styling using CSS.

3. Fetching Pokemon Data:
   - Utilized the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to the PokeApi.
   - Retrieved the list of Pokemon and displayed them in a grid format.
   - Implemented a "Load More" button to fetch additional Pokemon when needed.

4. Displaying Pokemon Details:
   - Created modal functionality to display detailed information about each Pokemon.
   - Fetched additional data for each Pokemon when clicked.

5. Marking Pokemon as Caught:
   - Implemented functionality to mark Pokemon as "caught" and store the caught Pokemon list in local storage.
   - Allowed users to release caught Pokemon from the list.

6. Final Touches:
   - Tested the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Added responsiveness to ensure the application works well on different devices.

Resources Used:
- PokeApi: Used to retrieve Pokemon data.
- Fetch API: Used for asynchronous data fetching.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used for building the frontend interface and functionality.
- GitHub: Used for version control and project management.

Challenges Faced:
- Working with asynchronous data fetching and handling promises effectively.
- Managing state and updating the UI dynamically based on user interactions.
- Ensuring compatibility and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.
- Implementing local storage functionality for storing caught Pokemon data and handling data persistence.

Overall, the development of the Pokedex web application was a rewarding experience, combining frontend development skills with API integration and data management. The project provided valuable insights into working with external APIs and building interactive webÂ applications.
